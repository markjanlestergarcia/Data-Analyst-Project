**SQL Project Compilation**
This repository is a **compilation of my SQL projects** that showcase my skills in Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Each project demonstrates how I use SQL to transform raw, messy data into clean, structured, and insight-ready datasets â€” a crucial step before any analysis or visualization.
